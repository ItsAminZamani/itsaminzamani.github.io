I am Amin Zamani, and my name is written in Persian as امین زمانی. I was born in the city of Isfahan, which is known for its rich history. Some people in Isfahan may know me because I started the CreativeMornings chapter in the city. As a software engineer, I spend most of my days writing code and attending technical meetings. I am passionate about microservices and cloud technologies. However, this is only one part of my life. In my personal life, I am an introvert who enjoys reading philosophical books and the novels of Dostoevsky.

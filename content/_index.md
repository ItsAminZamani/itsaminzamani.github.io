My name is Amin Zamani, which is written in Persian as امین زمانی . I was born in Isfahan, a city in Iran that is called "half the world," which means that this city has a lot of history. Some people in Isfahan knew me because I started the CreativeMornings Chapter of Isfahan.
As a software engineer, most of my day is spent writing code and going to technical meetings. I'm passionate about microservices and cloud technologies.
But this is just one part of my life. On the other hand, I'm an introvert who has a lot of philosophical books and loves Dostoevsky novels.

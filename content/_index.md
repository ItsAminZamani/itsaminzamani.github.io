As a tech-savvy Computer Scientist and Engineer hailing from the city of Isfahan, I am constantly seeking new ways to push the boundaries of microservices and cloud technologies. But when I'm not busy coding, you can find me indulging in my love for literature, film, and the works of great writers like Dostoevsky. As an introvert at heart, I find solace in the pages of a good book and the company of like-minded individuals who share a love for contemplating the mysteries of the human experience.
